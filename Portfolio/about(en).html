    <p>This is the capybara, one of the cutest animals in the world. The capybara (Hydrochoerus hydrochaeris) is the largest rodent in the world, native to South America.<br> The capybara is a social animal and lives in groups that can number from 10 to 20 individuals, but sometimes up to 100, especially in the dry seasons. It is a diurnal animal that spends most of its time feeding and resting, mainly feeding on grasses and aquatic plants. The capybara is an excellent swimmer and often submerges itself in water for long periods to cool off and avoid predators.<br> Within its group, the capybara uses a variety of vocalizations, such as whistling and snoring, to communicate. It is known for its tolerance of other animal species and can often be seen near other animals such as birds that use it as a high viewing platform.</p>
